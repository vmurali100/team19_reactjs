        <li><b>WHAT IS PHOTOGRAPHY</b></li>
        <ul type="square">
            <li style="font-style:initial;">Photography is the art of capturing light with a camera, <br> usually via a digital sensor or film, to create an image. </li>
            <li style="font-style:initial;">With the right camera equipment, you can even photograph wavelengths <br>of light invisible to the human eye, including UV, infrared, and radio.</li>
            <li style="font-style:initial;">The first permanent photograph was captured in 1826 (some sources say 1827) <br>by Joseph Nicéphore Niépce in France. </li>
        </ul>
        <li><b>DO YOU NEED A FANCY CAMERA?</b></li>
        <ul type="square">
            <li style="font-style:initial;">Many people today believe that their phone is good enough for most photography,<br> and they have no need to buy a separate camera. <br>And you know what? They’re not wrong. For most people out there, a dedicated camera is overkill.</li>
            <li style="font-style:initial;">Phones are better than dedicated cameras for most people’s needs. They’re quicker and easier to use, <br>not to mention their seamless integration with social media.</li>
